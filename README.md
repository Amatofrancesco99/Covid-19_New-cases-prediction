<h3>🇮🇹📈 Project description:</h3>

**[Covid-19](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1) fourth wave it's close** in Italy, but how we can know when the situation starts to be critical?
<br>
Since past events we know that the growth is almost an exponential, when a wave starts, so we want to predict the future trend, with a **good model**, knowing *a priori* what's happening in previous days.
<br>
Building a good model is essential in order to **avoid** taking **bad decisions** (for example lockdown when not needed, or no restrictions when needed).
<br>
Obviously the prediction is really complicated, because a **lot of variables have to be take into account**.
<br>An example: the third vaccination may produce a decrease effect in future trend (especially deaths).
<br><br>
As you may understood by the previous lines, the aim of this project is finding a good model to predict future trend, using **statistical learning theory**.
<br>
The regression function that have been used are the following one:
 *  *[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)*
 *  *[Polynomial Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)*
 *  *[Lasso Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))*
 *  *[Ridge Regression](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-ridge-regression/)*
 *  *[Natural Cubic Splines](https://towardsdatascience.com/numerical-interpolation-natural-cubic-spline-52c1157b98ac)*
